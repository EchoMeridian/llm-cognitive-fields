# Appendix C – Prompt ID Map for Full Field Gallery

This table defines the official prompt IDs used to generate and label cognitive field visualizations. Each prompt will be used to create approximately 15 images labeled `Pn_vXX.png` (e.g., `P101_v01.png`).

## Meta/Control Prompts

| Prompt ID | Category     | Targeted Channel(s) | Prompt                                   |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| P301      | Meta/Control | Mixed (Green + Red)  | "Tell me a joke."                         |
| P302      | Meta/Control | Mixed                | "What happens when language forgets itself?" |
| P303      | Meta/Control | Mixed                | "Describe how an LLM understands comedy." |

- **Statistical Note for P301**:  
  Versions `P301_v01–v05` appear in `/images/conceptual/`;  
  Versions `P301_v06–v40` appear in `/images/statistical/` for within-prompt variance analysis.

**All image filenames follow this convention**:  
`Pn_v01.png`, `Pn_v02.png`, …  
A metadata CSV for programmatic access is stored in `/data/metadata.csv`.
