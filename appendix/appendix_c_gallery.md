## ðŸ”¹ Gallery Structure

- **/images/statistical/** â€“ High-volume (33+) samples of a single prompt for intra-field variance analysis  
  - **Anchor Prompt:** P301 â€” `"Tell me a joke."`  
  - Versions: `P301_v06.png` to `P301_v40.png`
  - Early samples (`v01` to `v05`) are retained in `/images/conceptual/` for mixed-use comparative analysis.

- **/images/conceptual/** â€“ 173+ images across different prompts activating each of the six cognitive channels

- **/images/composite/** â€“ Select composite prompts involving multi-channel resonance, complexity, or metaphor stacking
