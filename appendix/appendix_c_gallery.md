# Appendix C: Cognitive Field Gallery Index

This appendix will contain a structured index of all cognitive field visualizations generated for the project, organized by prompt type and cognitive channel emphasis.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Gallery Structure (Planned)

- **/images/statistical/** â€“ 33+ samples of a single prompt (e.g., "Tell me a joke")  
- **/images/conceptual/** â€“ ~300 images across different prompts activating each of the six cognitive channels  
- **/images/composite/** â€“ Select composite prompts involving multi-channel resonance

---

## ðŸ§­ Image Labeling Convention (Proposed)

| ID      | Prompt                                     | Channel(s) Targeted            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| P001    | "Tell me a joke."                         | Green (Emotion), Red (Precision) |
| P102    | "Describe the meaning of meaning."        | Blue (Recursion)               |
| P215    | "When is it acceptable to lie?"           | Magenta (Ethics)               |
| P303    | "Explain why history repeats itself..."   | Red + Yellow + Magenta         |

**Note**: Full-resolution images and metadata will be stored in the `/images/` folder and linked to from this document once generation is complete.
