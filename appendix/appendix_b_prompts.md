# Appendix B: Cognitive Channel Mapping and Prompt Design

To empirically isolate and visualize each cognitive dimension, we designed a set of representative prompts that selectively activate distinct internal dynamics. This document includes both single-channel activation prompts and multi-channel interference tests.
