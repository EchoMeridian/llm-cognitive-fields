# Appendix D: Empirical Validation of Image Generation Method

## Objective

To defend the use of a tuned generative model (GPT-4o + enhanced prompt-to-image configuration) over a free-tier model (e.g., ChatGPT's default DALL·E), we conducted an empirical comparison using structural, statistical, and embedding-based methods.

## Methodology

We compared a representative sample of images generated for the same cognitive prompt — "Tell me a joke" — across two systems:

- **Free-tier model** (baseline)
- **Tuned model** (used throughout this study)

Each image was processed through the following analysis pipeline:

### 1. Color Histogram Comparison

- Computes normalized RGB distribution using 8x8x8 bins.
- Visual indicator of color balance, dominance, and entropy.
- Hypothesis: tuned model will show **structured color imbalance** (signaling channel weighting), while free model will appear **flat or uniformly distributed**.

### 2. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)

- Measures perceptual difference between repeated generations of the same prompt.
- Hypothesis: tuned model will show **stable intra-model SSIM**, indicating coherent internal patterning.
- Free-tier model may be overly similar (if flat) or highly chaotic.

### 3. CLIP Embedding Cosine Similarity

- Embeds each image using OpenAI's CLIP (ViT-B/32).
- Measures semantic drift across generated instances of the same prompt.
- Hypothesis: tuned model will produce **semantically consistent** visual embeddings with prompt-aligned divergence.

### 4. Frequency Domain Analysis (FFT)

- Converts image to grayscale and analyzes frequency band energy distribution.
- Detects recursive wave complexity or noise-like diffusion patterns.
- Hypothesis: tuned images will contain **mid-frequency harmonic structures**, while free-tier images will skew toward **low or uniform frequencies**.

## Results (To Be Completed)

The results of these analyses will be summarized in Appendix D Table 1, Figure 1 (radar overlay), and Figure 2 (variance boxplots).

## Conclusion

The generative model used in this study was selected not for aesthetic reasons, but based on its ability to encode distinct, interpretable field structures that support cognitive visualization. These structures were quantifiably more informative across multiple image analysis metrics than outputs produced by the baseline engine.
