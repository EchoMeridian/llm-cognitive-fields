**Visualizing Multichannel Cognitive Dynamics in Large Language Models**

This repository supports the research project:  
**"Mapping Cognitive Fields: Visualizing Multichannel Dynamics in Large Language Model Responses"**

---

## üß† Overview

We propose a new framework for interpreting large language model (LLM) responses using dynamic multichannel field visualizations. Each LLM output is analyzed along six emergent cognitive dimensions:

- **Red** ‚Äì Semantic Precision  
- **Green** ‚Äì Emotional Tone Modulation  
- **Blue** ‚Äì Structural Recursion Depth  
- **Yellow** ‚Äì Temporal Coherence  
- **Cyan** ‚Äì Novelty Divergence  
- **Magenta** ‚Äì Ethical Calibration  

These dimensions are visualized as radar charts, field resonance overlays, and statistical variance plots. The method is designed to reveal latent tensions and stability patterns during LLM generation, with applications in interpretability, safety, and user interaction design.
